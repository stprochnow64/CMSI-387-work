1. Operating systems and middleware are similar in many ways but there are several key differences between them. Middleware operates application programs and the operating system and is like a layer on top of the operating system. It uses services from the operating system and then provides services to the application programs to support controlled interaction. Operating systems and middleware rely upon different underlying providers of low-level services. An operating system provides the services in its API by making use of the features supported by its hardware while middleware provides the services in its API by making us of the features supported by its underlying operating system.

2. The relationship between threads and processes is as follows. They are both independent sequences of execution, but threads run in a shared memory space (same address) while processes do not. Processes are used for larger tasks and threads are used for smaller ones. Threads can come from multiple sources; they can come from multiple independent processes or from the same process, in which case that process would be a multithreaded process.

3. We are most looking forward to learning about: We have found the capability of an operating system to run multiple threads at the same time and switch threads to maximize efficiency and resource utilization to be the most interesting topic so far. We are looking forward to learning more about it and how to try and implement this capability ourselves in the projects we do in class.
