CMSI 387 Operating Systems
	Semester Project
===================================

OMG, this is a GREAT idea!!  Everyone gets so focused on being
serious about this stuff, it's refreshing to see a group take a
different tack on things.

Will there perhaps be a switch of some kind that will allow the
user to put the system into and take it out of the new mode?

I'm really excited about this....

Project approved.  Good work and good luck!
