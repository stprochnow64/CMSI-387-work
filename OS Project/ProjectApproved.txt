===================================

Sorry about the mix-up ----

This is a really cool idea!  Where will you get the horoscope
data from?  Will it be randomly generated?  Good idea to have
the command calculate the sign from the birthdate.


I'm really excited about this one, too!

Project approved.  Good work and good luck!
