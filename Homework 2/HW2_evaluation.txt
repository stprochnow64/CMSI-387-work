Results for Homework #2 Evaluation
==================================

Question 1 mutex reversing:          5/ 5 points
Question 2 auditing code change:     5/ 5 points
Question 3 test program:             20/20 points
Question 4 notifyall() addition:     10/10 points
Question 5a 2-phase locking:         5/ 5 points
Question 5b short read locks:        5/ 5 points
Question 5c snapshot isolation:      5/ 5 points
Question 6 virtual address xlate:    5/ 5 points
Question 7 calc. explanation:        5/ 5 points
Question 8 loop 4096 analysis:      20/20 points
Question 9 fork() tree:             10/15 points

Total 95 out of 100 = 95.00% which is an A

Comments:
---------
I had to take 5 points off for the tree in problem 9.  The
fork() process tree makes a different configuration than the
things you showed in your diagram.

There is no code for problems 3 and 4, so I can't really give you
credit for those.  I know you were working on them, perhaps they just
didn't get committed?  Let me know if they just need to be uploaded
and I'll update the evaluation when they appear...

Revised to include posted code for missing problems ~~ 2019-04-09

Nice work!
