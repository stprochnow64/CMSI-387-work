Comments:
---------
I had to take 5 points off for the tree in problem 9.  The
fork() process tree makes a different configuration than the
things you showed in your diagram.

There is no code for problems 3 and 4, so I can't really give you
credit for those.  I know you were working on them, perhaps they just
didn't get committed?  Let me know if they just need to be uploaded
and I'll update the evaluation when they appear...

Nice work!
