---------
Nice job on the Philosophers!  Good explanation for #5 as well.

Corrected!  sorry about that.....
[I don't see an answer for #2.  If you'll get that committed this week, I'll
add it in to the evaluation to get points back.]

Very close on #3.  You need to close the STDOUT_FILENO and then when you open
the "/etc/passwd" it will become the new input stream to your "tr" command.  I
had to take some points off for that...

Nice work!
